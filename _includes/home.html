                        Wisdom tells us that the whole cosmos is a singular continuous system of Non-Matter. Particular
                        energy which creates Matter originates from the Non-Matter and dissolves back into the
                        Non-Matter. This energy creates multiple things using the same Matter. The mind, made up of
                        Matter, has no access to that singular continuous Non-Matter. Duality exists in the realm of
                        Matter. The fastest particle made up of Matter takes more than four years to reach Earth from
                        the nearest star, which is 4.25 light-years far from Earth. Due to the physical limitations of
                        Matter, Space exploration using objects made up of Matter will be a futile effort, and hence we
                        are not into space exploration at all. We are in the business of providing tangible utilities
                        available on the earth.

                        Paromint is a collection of companies with one primary goal of securing and growing our
                        shareholder’s capital. Therefore, our team engages in businesses which are sustainable and not
                        speculative. We are working continuously to yield high ROI with caution not to compromise our
                        social equity. We are not a research organisation and do not experiment with investors’ capital.
                        Yet, we take calculated risks to excel in our line of business. We do not aspire to become
                        market leaders in any sector but follow the middle path to achieve a significant position in our
                        business areas. This way, we channelise our investments into yielding good EBIDTA. Metals,
                        Industrial commodities, Healthcare, Energy, Digital Infrastructure and Agriculture, are our
                        areas of expertise and are sectors where we are growing continuously. We treat our business like
                        mountaineering and not a 100-meter race and, therefore, build and grow the business one mindful
                        step at a time. Paromint is all about minding business and nothing else.
