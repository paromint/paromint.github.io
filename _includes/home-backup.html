                            Wisdom tells us that the whole cosmos is a singular continuous system of Non-Matter.
                            Particular energy which creates Matter originates from the Non-Matter and dissolves back
                            into the Non-Matter. This energy creates multiple things using the same Matter. The mind,
                            made up of Matter, has no access to that singular continuous Non-Matter. Duality exists in
                            the realm of Matter. The fastest particle made up of Matter takes more than four years to
                            reach Earth from the nearest star, which is 4.25 light-years far from Earth. Due to the
                            physical limitations of Matter, Space exploration using objects made up of Matter can never
                            lead to wisdom, and hence we are not into space exploration at all. We are in the business
                            of providing tangible utilities available on the earth.

                            Paromint is a collection of companies with one primary goal of securing and growing our
                            shareholder’s capital. Therefore, our team engages in businesses which are sustainable and
                            not speculative. We are working continuously to yield high ROI with caution not to
                            compromise our social equity. We are not a research organisation and do not experiment with
                            investors’ capital. Yet, we take calculated risks to excel in our line of business. We do
                            not aspire to become market leaders in any sector but follow the middle path to achieve a
                            significant position in our business areas. This way, we channelise our investments into
                            yielding good EBIDTA. Metals, Industrial commodities, Healthcare, Energy, Digital
                            Infrastructure and Agriculture, are our areas of expertise and are sectors where we are
                            growing continuously. We treat our business like mountaineering and not a 100-meter race
                            and, therefore, build and grow the business one mindful step at a time. Paromint is all
                            about minding business and nothing else.
